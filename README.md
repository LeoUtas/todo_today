### Introduction

This original project was built to help me track my daily to-do list. The app allows users to add new tasks, check completed tasks, and remove tasks from the list. Also, users can start a new day to monitor new daily tasks when the day is over. An important feature is tracking the percentage of completed tasks during the day throughout the user’s history.
